📊 Tariff Effects on Asian Countries’ GDP, Exports, and Imports (Power BI Dashboard)

🧩 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes the impact of newly imposed tariff rates (from August 2025 onwards) on the GDP, export, and import performance of selected Asian countries.

The dashboard provides a data-driven perspective on how trade policies influence national economies, helping policymakers, economists, and analysts make informed decisions.

🎯 Objective

To examine the relationship between tariff adjustments and economic indicators such as:

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

Export value

Import value

Trade balance trends post-tariff implementation

📁 Dataset Description

File Name: Tariff data set.pbix

Data Size: 100 rows (synthetic dataset created for analysis purposes)

Time Period: August 2025 – Present

Countries Covered: Multiple Asian economies

Data Attributes:

Country

Year

🔍 Key Insights

Tariff adjustments showed mixed economic impacts among Asian countries.

Export growth declined marginally in tariff-sensitive sectors.

GDP growth remained stable for nations with diversified trade bases.

Imports showed significant variation depending on domestic demand elasticity.

The trade balance improved in certain economies due to reduced import volumes.
